The spec is avaliable [here](./RedditLang%20Spec.md)

## Why Redditlang?

Redditlang is

- ðŸ”¥ blazingly fast
- ðŸŽ® cross platform

\*_Compiler\*\* is WIP, if you are looking for it. It will be here_  
\*\*_It may be Interpreted or JIT, but that is implementation specific_
**note**: We have realized that we have a younger audience, so we have translated the spec into Gen Z Slang "to make it bussin" [here](./RedditLang%20Spec%20GenZ.md)
