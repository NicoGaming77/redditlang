redditLang or PHL ( **P**rogramming **H**umor **L**anguage ) is a meme language devised by the r/ProgrammerHumor subreddit discord members

The spec is avaliable [here](./RedditLang%20Spec.md)

## Why Redditlang?

Redditlang is

- ðŸ”¥ blazingly fast
- ðŸŽ® cross platform
- Redditlang is the most opinionated language out there, forcing only the best of practices. For example, if you use inline macros, the police will be called and informed a fire has broken out at your home.\*

So what are you waiting for? Please invest your life savings in this!

\*_Compiler\*\* is WIP, if you are looking for it. It will be here_  
\*\*_It may be Interpreted or JIT, but that is implementation specific_
**note**: We have realized that we have a younger audience, so we have translated the spec into Gen Z Slang "to make it bussin" [here](./RedditLang%20Spec%20GenZ.md)
